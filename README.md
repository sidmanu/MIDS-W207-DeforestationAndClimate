# DeforestationAndClimate
As part of our Applied Machine Learning coursework, we did a project to build time-series models to predict temperature and other weather data for Tahoe, based on past weather data and global deforestation data. We explored various regression models like - Linear Regression, NN regressor, ARIMA, XGBoost regressor and LSTM and compared them.
